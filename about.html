    <p>Hi! My name is Christian (Bear) Brofft and I am currently a junior at
      Babson College pursuing a concentration in business analytics and entrepreneurship.
    I transferred to Babson this fall after spending two years at Boston University, where
  I attended the Questrom School of Business and was a member of the men's varsity lacrosse team. </p>
